# condenstation

A PRX plugin to re-enable connecting to Steam for the PS3.

This third-party project is not affiliated with nor endorsed by Valve Software.

## !! IMPORTANT !!

* This is very work-in-progress. It requires a lot of manual setup, no downloads are provided.
* Only works with Portal 2 for now, and possibly forever.
    * You **must** own / have access to [Portal 2 on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/620/).
* **I am not responsible for any damage to your Steam account, PSN account or PS3 for using this.** You aren't breaking any Steam rules, nor are you cheating, so you should not get (VAC) banned, but I am not responsible if you do somehow.
* PC Portal 2 co-op partners must be using the "demo_viewer" beta branch of Portal 2.
* **Team Fortress 2 (TF2) does not use Steam, and will NEVER be supported by this.**

## TODO (required for release)

* [x] Logging into Steam using a modern access token
* [x] Connecting to Steam without any external tools or PRX patches
* [x] Reading account details from a config file
* [x] Make binary version independent - no hardcoding addresses!
* [ ] Using `GetCMList` API and patching the existing binary's CM list
* [ ] Stubbing matchmaking (Portal 2 only)
    * Ideally we would figure out making it PS3/demo_viewer only, but that probably isn't possible.
* [x] Implementing on-console login
    * [ ] QR code login
        * [x] Steam auth backend logic
        * [x] QR code renderer
        * [x] Steam Overlay hooks for displaying QR code
        * [ ] UI/UX for end user
    * [x] Per-console encrypted token storage
* [x] Multiple accounts (1 per PS3 user)

## TODO (nice-to-haves, not required)

* [ ] Username/password + guard code login
    * I'm putting this off due to the complexity involved. I'm sorry.
* [ ] Neat blog on what all this does and why it is how it is
* [ ] Functioning on RPCS3
* [ ] Built in no-PSN patching (maybe Portal 2 only)
* [ ] Fixing or stubbing Steam Cloud
   * Anything to get rid of the endless "Syncing" on the menu.
* [ ] Upgrade netfilter to use newer authenticated encryption
   * Not *required* but would ~~avoid future deprecation.~~ be nice. It's unlikely legacy netfilter would be deprecated as they'd break any old game's dedicated server unless they asked admins to upgrade steamclient.
* [ ] CS:GO - this will be hard!
   * Uses AppID [720](https://steamdb.info/app/720/). Nobody owns this, so all calls fail by default! :(
   * Trying to use another AppID leads to "Searching" forever, even in private lobbies. Could entirely rely on [dedicated servers](https://steamdb.info/app/790/).
   * Needs a lot more research...

## Thanks/credits

* [relt from "SourceSPMP"](https://github.com/SourceSPMP/PS3Plugins) discovered Portal 2's ability to load native PRX addons without any game patches directly ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_jE5osEfRo)), as well as implemented the first re-implementation of crossplay (via direct IP connection, rather than Steam - meaning it will work forever!). Huge props.
* [SteamKit2](https://github.com/SteamRE/SteamKit) and SteamDB helped out a ton by having a documented history of the Steam3 communications protocol, as well as examples of how modern authentication and server communication is supposed to work. They've effectively documented almost every Steam3 protocol difference over the past 12+ years with their source code and commit history. Thanks!
* [vxzip](https://github.com/CRACKbomber/vxzip) was used to create the XZP2 files used by the console versions of the game.
* [nta](https://ntauthority.me) helped me get my bearings around Protobufs, SteamClient and the Steam API. Thanks! :3
