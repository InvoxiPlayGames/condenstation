A PRX plugin to re-enable connecting to Steam for the PS3 for Portal 2.

Requirements:
-------------
* A PS3 running either a custom firmware (CFW - such as Evilnat CFW), or a
  homebrew enabler. (HEN - such as PS3HEN)
* A copy of Portal 2 for the PS3.
* A PSN account.
* A Steam account that owns or has access to Portal 2, and has Steam Guard
  Mobile Authenticator set up on a phone with the Steam app.

Installation:
-------------
1. Extract the "portal2_dlc3" folder.
2. Using FTP, copy the portal2_dlc3 folder into the Portal 2 USRDIR folder on
   your PS3.
   * Europe: /dev_hdd0/game/BLES01222/USRDIR/
   * America, Disc: /dev_hdd0/game/BLUS30732/USRDIR/
